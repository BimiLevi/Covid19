# Covid19 - WorldMeter Web Scraper 
In this project, the goal is to scrape data regarding the Covid19 virus from the WorldMeter website.
The data is scraped once a day, then the data is manipulated using the panda's package. After the is manipulated it's been written onto a  cloud (Azure) database(Postergsql).
Finally, the data that was gathered is been analyzed using different Ml algorithms. 

##  Project Goals:
* Scrape data from the web using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
* Creation of a cloud (Azure) database (Postgresql), and write  the data into it.
* Analyze the extracted data using pandas and matplotlib and other packages.

### Project Stages:
1. Scarping the data into panda's dataframe.
2. Manipulate the raw data, so it will fit the desired pattern.
3. Creation of Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. 
4. Gathering data for future analysis. 
5. Analyzing and Visualizing the data.
6. Writing a comprehensive report. 

#### Project Status:
The project is currently in stage 4, during the time it takes to gather the data, the following actions will take place:
ERD creation for countries and continents tables.
Optimizing the code.
Creating an Analysis work plan.

# This project is still work in progress.
